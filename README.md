## Overall Learning 

This project reflects both my technical learning and collaborative development experience.
During this project, I worked closely with team members on RTL design using Verilog HDL.
I collaborated on FSM design, module integration, and interface definition to ensure system consistency.
We coordinated verification activities using a shared SystemVerilog testbench and waveform analysis.
Regular discussions and reviews helped resolve design issues and improve overall code quality.
This teamwork-based approach strengthened my communication skills and experience in collaborative,
industry-style digital hardware development.
